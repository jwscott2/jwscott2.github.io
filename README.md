Introduction:

Good Afternoon, Fellow Classmates. My name is Joshua Scott. I am a 25-year-old Navy Veteran, born and raised in Sanford, NC.I have previously attended ECPI University, where I was also pursuing Cybersecurity, and I look forward to completing my education here at Wake Tech. During my time in the military, I served as a Medic, which provided me with a lot of different experiences. I am married to my beautiful wife, and we currently have two handsome sons, with the third on the way. I look forward to working and interacting with everyone of you!

Academic Integrity: 

Here at Wake Tech, students and professors are instructed to uphold the Academic policies at all times. In my opinion, there are 2 key reasons why this is important. Reason number one is that everyone at this college, whether student or professor, worked hard to be in their current position, either financially or through the work that has been done. The only person you are doing a disservice to with cheating and or being dishonest is yourself. You would essentially be throwing away your time, effort, and money if you violated this policy, which is not worth it. Finally, reason two, one of the biggest, in my opinion, is that you learn nothing. When you violate the policy you're admitting that you didn't learn anything and you're trying to take the "easy way out". We work hard to take the classes that will provide us with the skills to operate in our fields outside of college. Imagine you're given a complex scenario in class and you cheat and this same scenario occurs in your job and you're clueless because you decided to cheat. There are plenty more reasons why this policy is important but hopefully, this gave you a brief yet thorough explanation of the importance of it.
